ServiceStack's **Add ServiceStack Reference** feature allows clients to generate Native Types from directly within VS.NET using [ServiceStackVS VS.NET Extension](/create-your-first-webservice) - providing a simple way to give clients typed access to your ServiceStack Services.

### First class development experience

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) has become a core part of our overall recommended solution 
for Web Apps that's integrated into all ServiceStackVS's 
[React and Aurelia Single Page App VS.NET Templates](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS) 
offering a seamless development experience with access to advanced ES6 features like modules, classes 
and arrow functions whilst still being able to target most web browsers with its down-level ES5 support. 
TypeScript also goes beyond ES6 with optional Type Annotations enabling better tooling support and compiler 
type feedback than what's possible in vanilla ES6 - invaluable when scaling large JavaScript codebases.

We're actively tracking TypeScript's evolution and looking forward to integrating
[TypeScript 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/07/11/announcing-typescript-2-0-beta/)
once it leaves beta.

### Ideal Typed Message-based API

The TypeScript `JsonServiceClient` available in the 
[servicestack-client npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/servicestack-client) enables the same 
productive, typed API development experience available in our other 1st-class supported client platforms. 

ServiceStack embeds additional type hints in each Request DTO in order to achieve the ideal typed, 
message-based API. You can see an example of this is below which shows how to create a C# Gist in 
[Gislyn](http://gistlyn.com) after adding a ServiceStack Reference to `gistlyn.com` and installing the 
[servicestack-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/servicestack-client) npm package: 

```ts
import { JsonServiceClient } from 'servicesack-client';
import { StoreGist, GithubFile } from './Gistlyn.dtos';

var client = new JsonServiceClient("http://gistlyn.com");

var request = new StoreGist();
var file = new GithubFile();
file.filename = "main.cs";
file.content = 'var greeting = "Hi, from TypeScript!";';
request.files = { [file.filename]: file };

client.post(request)
    .then(r => { // r:StoreGistResponse
        console.log(`New C# Gist was created with id: ${r.gist}`);
        location.href = `http://gistlyn.com?gist=${r.gist}`;
    })
    .catch(e => {
        console.log("Failed to create Gist: ", e.responseStatus);
    });
```

Where the `r` param in the returned `then()` Promise callback is typed to `StoreGistResponse` DTO Type.

## TypeScript ServiceClient

The `servicestack-client` is a clean "jQuery-free" implementation based on JavaScript's new 
[Fetch API standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), 
utilizing the [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch) implementation
so it can be used in both JavaScript client web apps as well as node.js server projects.

### [servicestack-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/servicestack-client)

The easiest way to use TypeScript with ServiceStack is to start with one of 
[ServiceStackVS TypeScript projects](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS). 

Other TypeScript or ES6 projects can install `servicestack-client` with:

    jspm install servicestack-client

and node server projects can instead install it with:

    npm install servicestack-client --save

The Type Definitions are contained in the above `servicestack-client` npm package, if using jspm it 
can be installed with:

    npm install servicestack-client --save-dev

### TypeScript Ambient Interface Definitions or Concrete Types

You can get both concrete types and interface definitions for your Services at the following routes:

  - [/types/typescript](http://techstacks.io/types/typescript) - for generating concrete types
  - [/types/typescript.d](http://techstacks.io/types/typescript.d) - for generating ambient interface definitions

## [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference)

The easiest way to Add a ServiceStack reference to your project is to **right-click** on a folder to bring up 
[ServiceStackVS's](/create-your-first-webservice)
VS.NET context-menu item, then click on `Add -> TypeScript Reference...`. This opens a dialog where you can 
add the url of the ServiceStack instance you want to typed DTO's for, as well as the name of the DTO source 
file that's added to your project.

![Add ServiceStack Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/servicestackvs/add-typescript-reference-js.png)

After clicking OK, the servers DTO's are added to the project, yielding an instant typed API:

![TypeScript native types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/servicestackvs/add-typescript-reference-dtos.png)

### Update ServiceStack Reference

If your server has been updated and you want to update the client DTOs, simply **right-click** on the DTO file 
within VS.NET and select **Update ServiceStack Reference** for **ServiceStackVS** to download a fresh update. 

### TypeScript Reference Example

Lets walk through a simple example to see how we can use ServiceStack's TypeScript DTO annotations in our 
JavaScript clients. Firstly we'll need to add a TypeScript Reference to the remote ServiceStack Service by 
**right-clicking** on your project and clicking on `Add > TypeScript Reference...` 
(as seen in the above screenshot).

This will import the remote Services dtos into your local project which looks similar to:

```
/* Options:
Date: 2016-08-11 22:23:24
Version: 4.061
Tip: To override a DTO option, remove "//" prefix before updating
BaseUrl: http://techstacks.io

//GlobalNamespace: 
//MakePropertiesOptional: True
//AddServiceStackTypes: True
//AddResponseStatus: False
//AddImplicitVersion: 
//AddDescriptionAsComments: True
//IncludeTypes: 
//ExcludeTypes: 
//DefaultImports: 
*/

// @Route("/technology/{Slug}")
export class GetTechnology implements IReturn<GetTechnologyResponse>
{
    Slug: string;
    createResponse() { return new GetTechnologyResponse(); }
    getTypeName() { return "GetTechnology"; }
}

export class GetTechnologyResponse
{
    Created: string;
    Technology: Technology;
    TechnologyStacks: TechnologyStack[];
    ResponseStatus: ResponseStatus;
}
```

In keeping with idiomatic style of local `.ts` sources, generated types are not wrapped within a module 
by default. This lets you reference the types you want directly using normal import destructuring syntax:

```ts
import { GetTechnology, GetTechnologyResponse } from './dtos';
```

Or import all Types into your preferred variable namespace with:

```ts
import * as dtos from './dtos';

const request = new dtos.GetTechnology();
```

Or if preferred, you can instead have the types declared in a module by specifying a `GlobalNamespace`:

```ts
/* Options:
...

GlobalNamespace: dtos
*/
```

Looking at the types we'll notice the DTO's are plain TypeScript Types with any .NET attributes 
added in comments using AtScript's proposed 
[meta-data annotations format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YUzC-1d0V1-Q3V0fQ7KSit97HnZoKVygDxpWzEYW0U/mobilebasic?viewopt=127). 
This lets you view helpful documentation about your DTO's like the different custom routes available 
for each Request DTO.

By default DTO properties are optional but can be made a required field by annotating the .NET property 
with the `[Required]` attribute or by uncommenting `MakePropertiesOptional: False` in the header comments 
which instead defaults to using required properties.

Properties always reflect to match the remote servers JSON Serialization configuration, 
i.e. will use **camelCase** properties when the `AppHost` is configured with:

```csharp
JsConfig.EmitCamelCaseNames = true;
```

### Making Typed API Requests

Making API Requests in TypeScript is the same as all other
[ServiceStack's Service Clients](/clients-overview)
by sending a populated Request DTO using a `JsonServiceClient` which returns typed Response DTO.

So the only things we need to make any API Request is the `JsonServiceClient` from the `servicestack-client` 
package and any DTO's we're using from generated TypeScript ServiceStack Reference, e.g:

```ts
import { JsonServiceClient } from 'servicestack-client';
import { GetTechnology } from './dtos';

const client = new JsonServiceClient("http://techstacks.io");

const request = new GetTechnology();
request.Slug = "ServiceStack";

client.get(request)
    .then(r => {                  // typed to GetTechnologyResponse
        cont tech = r.Technology; // typed to Technology

        console.log(`${tech.Name} by ${tech.VendorName} (${tech.ProductUrl})`);
        console.log(`${tech.Name} TechStacks:`, r.TechnologyStacks);
    });
```

### Sending additional arguments with Typed API Requests

Many AutoQuery Services utilize [implicit conventions](/autoquery-rdbms#implicit-conventions) to 
query fields that aren't explicitly defined on AutoQuery Request DTOs, these can be queried by specifying
additional arguments with the typed Request DTO, e.g:

```ts
const request = new FindTechStacks();

client.get(request, { VendorName: "ServiceStack" })
    .then(r => { })               // typed to QueryResponse<TechnologyStack> 
```

### Making API Requests with URLs

In addition to making Typed API Requests you can also call Services using relative or absolute urls, e.g:

```ts
client.get<GetTechnologyResponse>("/technology/ServiceStack")

client.get<GetTechnologyResponse>("http://techstacks.io/technology/ServiceStack")

// http://techstacks.io/technology?Slug=ServiceStack
client.get<GetTechnologyResponse>("/technology", { Slug: "ServiceStack" }) 
```

## DTO Customization Options 

In most cases you'll just use the generated TypeScript DTO's as-is, however you can further customize how
the DTO's are generated by overriding the default options.

The header in the generated DTO's show the different options TypeScript native types support with their 
defaults. Default values are shown with the comment prefix of `//`. To override a value, remove the `//` 
and specify the value to the right of the `:`. Any uncommented value will be sent to the server to override 
any server defaults.

The DTO comments allows for customizations for how DTOs are generated. The default options that were used 
to generate the DTO's are repeated in the header comments of the generated DTOs, options that are preceded 
by a TypeScript comment `//` are defaults from the server, any uncommented value will be sent to the server 
to override any server defaults.

```ts
/* Options:
Date: 2015-11-21 00:32:00
Version: 4.048
BaseUrl: 

GlobalNamespace: dtos
//MakePropertiesOptional: True
//AddServiceStackTypes: True
//AddResponseStatus: False
//AddImplicitVersion: 
//IncludeTypes: 
//ExcludeTypes: 
//DefaultImports: 
*/
```

We'll go through and cover each of the above options to see how they affect the generated DTO's:

### Change Default Server Configuration

The above defaults are also overridable on the ServiceStack Server by modifying the default config on the 
`NativeTypesFeature` Plugin, e.g:

```csharp
//Server example in CSharp
var nativeTypes = this.GetPlugin<NativeTypesFeature>();
nativeTypes.MetadataTypesConfig.GlobalNamespace = "dtos";
...
```

We'll go through and cover each of the above options to see how they affect the generated DTO's:

### GlobalNamespace

Changes the name of the module that contain the generated TypeScript definitions:

```ts
declare module dtos
{
    ...
}
```

### ExportAsTypes

Changes whether types should be generated as ambient interface definitions or exported as concrete Types:

```ts
module dtos
{
    export interface IReturnVoid
    {
    }
    ...
}
```

### MakePropertiesOptional

Changes whether the default of whether each property is optional or not:

```ts
interface Answer
{
    AnswerId: number;
    Owner: User;
    IsAccepted: boolean;
    Score: number;
    LastActivityDate: number;
    LastEditDate: number;
    CreationDate: number;
    QuestionId: number;
}
```

### AddResponseStatus

Automatically add a `ResponseStatus` property on all Response DTO's, regardless if it wasn't already defined:

```ts
interface GetAnswers extends IReturn<GetAnswersResponse>
{
    ...
    ResponseStatus: ResponseStatus;
}
```

### AddImplicitVersion

Lets you specify the Version number to be automatically populated in all Request DTO's sent from the client: 

```ts
interface GetAnswers extends IReturn<GetAnswersResponse>
{
    Version: number; //1
    ...
}
```

This lets you know what Version of the Service Contract that existing clients are using making it easy 
to implement ServiceStack's [recommended versioning strategy](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12413091/85785). 

## TypeScript Interface Definitions

By checking **Only TypeScript Definitions** check-box on the dialog when Adding a TypeScript Reference
you can instead import Types as a
[TypeScript declaration file](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#writing-dts-files) (.d.ts).

TypeScript declarations are just pure static type annotations, i.e. they don't generate any code or 
otherwise have any effect on runtime behavior. This makes them useful as a non-invasive drop-in into 
existing JavaScript code where it's just used to provide type annotations on existing JavaScript objects, 
letting you continue using your existing data types and ajax libraries.

### Referencing TypeScript DTO's

Once added to your project, use VS.NET's JavaScript doc comments to reference the TypeScript definitions 
in your `.ts` scripts. The example below shows how to use the above TypeScript definitions to create a 
typed Request/Response utilizing jQuery's Ajax API to fire off a new Ajax request on every keystroke:

```html
/// <reference path="MyApis.dtos.d.ts"/>
...

<input type="text" id="txtHello" data-keyup="sayHello" /> 
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
$(document).bindHandlers({
    sayHello: function () {
        var request: dtos.Hello = {};
        request.title = "Dr";
        request.name = this.value;
        
        $.getJSON(createUrl("/hello", request), request, 
            function (r: dtos.HelloResponse) {
                $("#result").html(r.result);
            });
    }
});

function createUrl(path: string, params: any): string {
    for (var key in params) {
        path += path.indexOf('?') < 0 ? "?" : "&";
        path += key + "=" + encodeURIComponent(params[key]);
    }
    return path;
}
</script>
```

Here we're just using a simple inline `createUrl()` function to show how we're creating the url for the 
**GET** HTTP Request by appending all Request DTO properties in the QueryString, resulting in a HTTP GET 
Request that looks like:

    /hello?title=Dr&name=World

There's also a new `$.ss.createUrl()` API in 
[ss-utils.js](/ss-utils-js)
which also handles .NET Route definitions where it will populate any variables in the `/path/{info}` 
instead of adding them to the `?QueryString`, e.g:

```js
$(document).bindHandlers({
    sayHello: function () {
        var request: dtos.Hello = {};
        request.title = "Dr";
        request.name = this.value;
        
        $.getJSON($.ss.createUrl("/hello/{Name}", request), request, 
            function (r: dtos.HelloResponse) {
                $("#result").html(r.result);
            });
    }
});
```

Which results in a HTTP GET request with the expected Url:

    /hello/World?title=Dr

### [ServerEvents Client](/typescript-server-events-client)

The [TypeScript ServerEventClient](typescript-server-events-client) is an idiomatic port of ServiceStack's 
[C# Server Events Client](/csharp-server-events-client) in native TypeScript providing a productive 
client to consume ServiceStack's [real-time Server Events](/server-events) that can be used in both 
TypeScript Web and node.js server applications.

```ts
const channels = ["home"];
const client = new ServerEventsClient("/", channels, {
    handlers: {
        onConnect: (sub:ServerEventConnect) => {  // Successful SSE connection
            console.log("You've connected! welcome " + sub.displayName);
        },
        onJoin: (msg:ServerEventJoin) => {        // User has joined subscribed channel
            console.log("Welcome, " + msg.displayName);
        },
        onLeave: (msg:ServerEventLeave) => {      // User has left subscribed channel
            console.log(user.displayName + " has left the building");
        },
        onUpdate: (msg:ServerEventUpdate) => {    // User
            console.log(user.displayName + " channels subscription were updated");
        },        
        onMessage: (msg:ServerEventMessage) => {}  // Invoked for each other message
        //... Register custom handlers
        CustomMessage: (msg:CustomMessage) = {}    // Handle CustomMessage Request DTO
    },
    receivers: { 
        //... Register any receivers
        tv: {
            watch: function (id) {                 // Handle 'tv.watch {url}' messages 
                var el = document.querySelector("#tv");
                if (id.indexOf('youtu.be') >= 0) {
                    var v = splitOnLast(id, '/')[1];
                    el.innerHTML = templates.youtube.replace("{id}", v);
                } else {
                    el.innerHTML = templates.generic.replace("{id}", id);
                }
                el.style.display = 'block'; 
            },
            off: function () {                     // Hanndle 'tv.off' messages
                var el = document.querySelector("#tv");
                el.style.display = 'none';
                el.innerHTML = '';
            }
        }
    }
}).start();
```

When publishing a DTO Type for your Server Events message, your clients will be able to benefit from 
the generated DTOs in [TypeScript ServiceStack References](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference).
